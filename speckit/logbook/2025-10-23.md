# 2025-10-23

## Summary
- Initialised the Speckit operating system and captured the October 2025 application review.
- Hardened auth, wired asset generation/download, and aligned frontend/back-end contracts.

## Details
- Added baseline guardrails for AI collaborators (`speckit/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`).
- Created documentation workflows scaffold and logbook instructions.
- Recorded backend/frontend parity gaps in `speckit/reviews/2025-10-23-application-review.md`.
- Replaced placeholder asset endpoints with Puppeteer-backed PDF generation and secure downloads.
- Retooled auth flow: session-token-based login, immediate JWT issuance for returning users, and shared Prisma client/log configuration.
- Updated frontend stores/UI to respect preview mode, consume new asset metadata, and remove dead API calls.
- Added `speckit/workflows/asset-templates.md` to document the template authoring process.
- Published a minimal checklist (`docs/asset-template-quickstart.md`) for quick template updates.

## Follow-ups
- [ ] Add basic rate limiting to code validation and login endpoints.
- [ ] Introduce automated smoke tests covering code entry → wizard → asset download flow.
